# Data-Analyst-Project
Now, I am a Rotating Reliability Solution Engineer with more than two years of experience, I have focused on reducing plant breakdowns and ensuring optimal machine health through predictive maintenance strategies. Additionally, I enhance my skills in data analytics through self-learning, data analytics bootcamp and seeking a position that offers the opportunity to change my career path to data analyst.

**Projects**
1. Shaft centerline of centrifugal compressor
> I collected raw data from the vibration probes and used it to analyze the shaft centerline. Then, I plotted the shaft position using Python, resulting in the following image. The shaft was observed to move normally, with a slight shift to the right, which corresponds to its counterclockwise (CCW) rotation.
