# Data-Analyst-Project
Now, I am a Rotating Reliability Solution Engineer with more than two years of experience, I have focused on reducing plant breakdowns and ensuring optimal machine health through predictive maintenance strategies. Additionally, I enhance my skills in data analytics through self-learning, data analytics bootcamp and seeking a position that offers the opportunity to change my career path to data analyst.

**Projects**
1. Shaft centerline of centrifugal compressor
I collected raw data from the vibration probes and used it to analyze the shaft centerline.
- I plotted the shaft position using Python, resulting in the following image. The shaft was observed to move normally, with a slight shift to the right, which corresponds to its counterclockwise (CCW) rotation.

2. Sale Performance   
I have a demo dataset containing sales transaction data.
- 2.1 The overall sales performance over the last 7 days shows an increasing trend.
- 2.2 Total spending remained relatively stable throughout 2007. However, spending in Q1 2008 appears lower, likely because the transaction data was only collected up to January 6, 2008.
- 2.3 In the last 7 days, total spending in regions N03, W01, and S03 has shown a declining trend. These regions should be prioritized for further investigation to understand the cause.
Additionally, product D00002 was the most popular. It may be beneficial to create a promotion that combines this high-performing product with lower-selling products to boost overall sales.
